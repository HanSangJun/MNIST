### MNIST Classification with Pure Tensorflow
Although MNIST example has been tutorial for deep learning beginner, it is not easy as we might think. Especially for Tensorflow, many users have difficulty on applying MNIST examples to their domain problems. This is because Tensorflow provides tutorial-specific API for MNIST such as load data and batch extraction. Here, I tried to implement MNIST classification using pure python and tensorflow. If you want to be a professional developer without high-level API (such as Keras), I recommend this.

On Kaggle MNIST dataset, I got 0.99542 accuracy.
